# TL;DR
## Chapter 1
First of all, the name. [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry):

_"Haskell Brooks Curry [...] was an American mathematician and logician. Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic; while the initial concept of combinatory logic was based on a single paper by Moses Schönfinkel, much of the development was done by Curry. Curry is also known for Curry's paradox and the Curry–Howard correspondence. There are three programming languages named after him, __Haskell__, __Brook__ and __Curry__, as well as the concept of currying, a technique used for transforming functions in mathematics and computer science."_

Haskell programs could run more slowly than similar programs written in C/C++. That's because Haskell is focused in productivity and reliability, outweighing -- for those who care about it -- any performance advantage that others languages might perform.

Haskell is know for:
* Emphasizes safety;
* Being used in the industry and being Open Source.

GHC: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

#### Boolean
In C is used the __!__ operator, in Haskell is __not__ operator.
