> Learning exercises in Haskell.

## About
Beginning the journey of learning Haskell, here are some of my process notes and exercises.

Major notes are being taking from:
1. [Haskell book](http://haskellbook.com/);
2. [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/);
3. [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026365.do).

The ordering matters because some notes that were taken of the previous book would be redundant if pasted in the next. And some of them I've read concurrently.
